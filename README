A simple technique for making ajax request/response debugging easier.

This example provides a wrapper for jQuery.ajax. You also need to put something similar to
logged-ajax.html into your base html template (or you could write those tags in to the page
from javascript).

I use this technique as an alternative to Chrome's dev tools which can't show rendered HTML
as returned by an XMLHttpRequest.
